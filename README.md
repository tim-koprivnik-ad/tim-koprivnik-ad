### Hello fellow apes! üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Tim and I'm a self-taught Web (Frontend) Developer (& a bit of Designer) with humanistic and social background, in search of a peaceful, intentional, and unstressed life, who likes to learn new things, self-improve, read, watch docuseries, do sports, travel and meet unique people. Two things I cannot live without are chill music and the feeling of not being stuck. One of the mottos I try to remind myself daily is, ‚ÄúAbove all else, be kind.‚Äù
