### Hello, fellow apes! üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is Tim and I'm a self-taught Frontend (Web) Developer (& a bit of Designer) with humanistic and social background, in search of a peaceful, intentional, and unstressed life, who likes to learn new things, self-improve, read, watch (docu)series, do sports, travel, and meet unique people. Two things I cannot live without are chill music and the feeling of not being stuck. One of my idealistic life goals is to witness a world where money (or materialistic bs in general) wouldn't be the primary goal of it all, and exploitation not an everyday human relation. Above all else, I try to be fair and empathetic, and I expect the same thing from anyone else. In the end, I'm like Newton's 3rd law -- I give what I get.
